    <h1 id="onfr" href="#"> Other Non-Functional Requirements </h1><br>

      <h3>Performance Requirements</h3>
      <p>For this system one of our main concern is performance. Since the core objective of this project is to digitize existing documents/files from the Department of Finance,we have to prioritize time.
     </p>
      <br>

      <h3>Safety Requirements</h3>
      <p>We won't have to deal with security problems too much because this is an online platform.However, in order to prevent unnecessary risks and emergencies, the system would be able to warn other users who are breaking community standards and in case of emergency it will suspend the user immedietly and in case of system failure automatically system data will be backedup.
     </p>
      <br>

      <h3>Security Requirements</h3>
      <p>
        Users will be able to use their Google accounts to register. This will establish whether or not they are genuine users.In case of any kind of data and account information change administrator will be notified as early as possible and give limit for login attempt to avoid brute-force attack.
     </p>
      <br>

      <h3>Software Quality Attributes</h3>
      <h6>Adaptabilityâ€‹</h6>
       <p>We'll try to make it as adaptable as possible to fix problems.</p>
      <h6>Availability</h6>
       <p> The system will remain within the database and there will be no time constraints. It will be also portable as user can access the softwere through android devices and Internet services.</p>
      <h6>Maintainabilityâ€‹</h6>
      <p>To improve its reusability and efficiency, the platform will be maintainable efficiencently and method should be written in such way that other developer could work and maintain as per need very easily.</p>
